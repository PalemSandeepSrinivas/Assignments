    "# 1. What does an empty dictionary&#39;s code look like?\n",
    "To create an empty dictionary, the dictionary should be set to {}. This is shown in the code below. So, with this code above, we create a dictionary called items which is set equal to {}. \n",
    "So this dictionary named items is empty.\n",

    "# 3. What is the most significant distinction between a dictionary and a list?\n",
    "\n",
    "A list is an ordered sequence of objects, whereas dictionaries are unordered sets. However, the main difference is that\n",
    "items in dictionaries are accessed via keys and not via their position.\n",
