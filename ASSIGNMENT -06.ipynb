    "\n",
    "In Python strings, the backslash \"\\\" is a special character, also called the \"escape\" character. It is used in representing \n",
    "certain whitespace characters: \"\\t\" is a tab, \"\\n\" is a newline, and \"\\r\" is a carriage return. Conversely, prefixing a special\n",
    "character with \"\\\" turns it into an ordinary character.\n",

    "\n",
