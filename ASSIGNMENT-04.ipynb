    "# 10. What is difference between the list methods append() and insert()?\n",
    "\n",
    "The only difference between append() and insert() is that insert function allows us to add a specific element at a specified \n",

    "\n",
    "# 11. What are the two methods for removing items from a list?\n",

    "The methods are remove(), pop() and clear(). It helps to remove the very first given element matching from the list. \n",

    "\n",
    "The similarity between Lists and Strings in Python is that both are sequences. The differences between them are that firstly,\n",
    "Lists are mutable but Strings are immutable. Secondly, elements of a list can be of different types whereas a String only\n",

    "\n",
    "# 13. What's the difference between tuples and lists?\n",
    "\n",
    "The key difference between the tuples and lists is that while the tuples are immutable objects the lists are mutable.\n",
    "This means that tuples cannot be changed while the lists can be modified. Tuples are more memory efficient than the lists.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Use the list comprehension statement [list(x) for x in tuples] to convert each tuple in tuples to a list. \n",
    "This also works for a list of tuples with a varying number of elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 16. Variables that contain list values are not necessarily lists themselves. Instead, what do they contain?\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables will contain references to list values rather than list values themselves. But for strings and integer values, \n",
    "variables simply contain the string or integer value.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 17. How do you distinguish between copy.copy() and copy.deepcopy()?\n",
    "\n",
    "copy() create reference to original object. If you change copied object - you change the original object. \n",
    "deepcopy() creates new object and does real copying of original object to new one. Changing new deepcopied object \n",
    "does not affect original object.\n",
