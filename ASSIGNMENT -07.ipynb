    "The re. compile() function returns Regex objects.\n",

    "# 2. Why do raw strings often appear in Regex objects?\n",
    "\n",
    " Raw strings are used so that backslashes do not have to be escaped.\n",

    "# 3. What is the return value of the search() method? \n",
    "\n",
    "The re.search() function takes two parameters and returns a match object if there is a match. If there is more than one match,\n",
    "only the first occurrence of the match will be returned. If no matches are found, the value None is returned.\n",

    "# 4. From a Match item, how do you get the actual strings that match the pattern?\n",

    "The group() method returns strings of the matched text.\n",

    "# 5. In the regex which created from the (\\d\\d\\d)-(\\d\\d\\d-\\d\\d\\d\\d), what does group zero cover?\n",
    "Group 2? Group 1?\n",
    "\n",
    "Group 0 is the entire match, group 1 covers the first set of parentheses, and group 2 covers the second set of parentheses.\n",

    "# 6. In standard expression syntax, parentheses and intervals have distinct meanings. How can you tell\n",
    "a regex that you want it to fit real parentheses and periods?\n",

    "Periods and parentheses can be escaped with a backslash: \\., \\(, and \\).anaconda/\n",

    "the two options?\n",
